This is the folder that contains code related to Nick Barton's implementation of the infinitesimal model with linkage in Mathematica
The notebooks are divided into two part, one containing mostly definitions, and the other one the main functions to run the simulations.
The initialization cells need to be evaluated before the estimation code and the simulations can be run.

Key dependency data are supplied as .csv files.
