# Longshanks
We are currently in the process of cleaning up the code and putting them up as we work through them. Apologies in advance. 

Currently, we have provided the Mathematica code that Nick Barton has written to estimate the relevant selection paramters from the data, as well as performing a forward simulation of the genome under the given set of estimated parameters. These are available under the folder infinitesimal_model_with_linkage.

We are still working through our pipeline and files to upload. Ultimately, we intend to include all code that would generate the figures, perform simulations and give key examples of our data analysis pipelines.
